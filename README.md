Previously, team memeber had to manually copy and paste specific fields from the database to compile constituent's bios, a process that was time-consuming. This application automate the retrieval and formatting of constituent's data, significantly reducing the time and effort required to produce the bios. It was developed to address the inefficiencies faced by the Research team in the Advancement Services Team at NMSU Foundation.
